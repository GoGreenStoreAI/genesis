To publish a signed release you'll need:
  - A Java keystore (.keystore or .jks) and password
  - Configure signing in cordova/app Gradle or use apksigner
  - Add secrets to GitHub Actions to sign and upload:
      ANDROID_KEYSTORE (base64 or stored in Actions secret as file),
      ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD,
      ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS,
      ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD

The Action above will produce an unsigned release APK and upload it to workflow artifacts.
